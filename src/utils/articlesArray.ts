  <p>
    If you're eager to see what your wardrobe might look like this
    autumn keep reading, because thanks to the world's four fashion
    capitals - that's New York, London, Milan and Paris - who are
    always ahead of the curve, autumn/winter 2023's fashion trends
    were forecasted way back in February.
  </p>
  <p>
    These are the key sartorial takeaways to prep yourself for the new
    season…
  </p>
  <h2>1. PERPETUAL PLEATING</h2>
  <p>
    One of the simplest ways to elevate a look, pleating is back in a
    big way this season. Whether you opt for a soft, draped pleat à la
    Loewe or a more intricate, dense pleat like Paco Rabanne and Rokh,
    it's a great way to add a sense of texture without
    overcomplicating a look through various different fabrics or
    layers. Keep the rest of your outfit relatively monochrome in
    order to let the pleating do the talking.
  </p>
  <h2>2. THE NEW PEPLUM</h2>
  <p>
    Buckle up, folks, because you didn't misread that. The peplum is
    officially back on the fashion map (we did warn you that you might
    need a while to digest these trends before you trial them!), and
    whether or not you were into them first time around you'd be wise
    not to disregard the look this season. Creating a beautiful
    silhouette, the traditional fit-and-flare shape of a peplum piece
    renders it universally flattering, and is a great way to dress up
    an otherwise more understated look.
  </p>
  <h2>3. QUIET LUXURY</h2>
  <p>
    One of the easiest trends to get on board with this autumn/winter,
    quiet luxury has been gaining pace on the sartorial scene over
    recent months. Essentially the opposite of flamboyant displays of
    wealth via logos and instantly-recognisable designer prints, this
    is about the art of subtlety. From timeless vests to blazers and
    even simply well-cut jeans, quiet luxury will be one of the wisest
    trends to follow this season thanks to its timeless longevity.
  </p>
  <h2>4. RED ALERT</h2>
  <p>
    People always want to know about ‘the colour of the season’, and
    while fuchsia is still having its moment thanks to the Barbie
    movie there's no doubt amongst fashion insiders that the real
    on-trend hue for autumn is red. Not a soft red, not a ruby, a
    crimson or a burgundy, but good old fashioned scarlet. Wear it
    head-to-toe for bonus points.
  </p>
  <h2>5. SHEER REVELATIONS</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, we know, it's the trend that won't give up. But with
    designers forever pushing the boundaries with sheer dressing, it's
    no wonder we don't get bored. This season you're going to have to
    put on your big girl pants - both literally and figuratively - as
    the sheer trend is all about revealing yours. That's right, there
    are no modest slip dresses or cool trousers slung beneath these
    sheer sheaths - baring your briefs will be big this autumn.
  </p>
  <h2>6. THE LBC</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most wearable trends of the season, the LBC (Long Black
    Coat) is the coolest outerwear option for autumn. While
    impractical floor scrapers may be at the top of the list when it
    comes to runway trends, there's no need for yours to be sweeping
    the pavements every time you leave the house. Opt for one that
    falls just above the ankle like Victoria Beckham's for an easy
    throw-on piece that won't look tired before October even hits.
  </p>
  <h2>7. MOODY BLOOMS</h2>
  <p>
    Many of us love florals come spring and summer (Miranda
    Priestly-aside, of course), but have you ever considered them an
    autumnal staple? That's all about to change, with moodier-hued
    blooms having taken centre stage on the AW23 runways. Go for those
    with a deep base colour - black or charcoal grey, ideally - and
    let the floral pop on top. Whether it's one bloom or a few, it's a
    guaranteed way to brighten up the fashion landscape in the depths
    of winter.
  </p>
  <h2>8. TIGHTS IN SIGHT</h2>
  <p>
    We'd be lying if we said we weren't into all of these
    practicality-first trends emerging from the designer catwalks.
    Next up, it's tights. Not the subtle nude ones, or the functional
    black pair you reach for every time the temperature dips into
    single digits. No, these are shout-about-it, out-there pairs of
    tights that were made to be seen. Bright reds were all over the
    runways this season, but there really are no rules here. Red,
    blue, pink, green, white… we're here for them all.
  </p>
  <h2>9. BUTTER STICKS</h2>
  <p>
    A slightly subtler, but no less beautiful, colour trend emerging
    for autumn is this buttery, pastel-y yellow-y gold tone. Worn
    head-to-toe it often also ticks off the ‘quiet luxury’ trend too
    as it exudes such subtle elegance, but it's also one of the
    easiest shades to wear. Unlike the slightly louder trend for
    scarlet red, this is a more subdued colour trend which is a lot
    less intimidating to step into.
  </p>
  <h2>10. SCARF SWATHES</h2>
  <p>
    Undoubtedly less tempting as those of us in the UK sit here
    basking in 28°C (it happens less often than once in a blue moon,
    let us have it), trust us when we say give it a few months and
    we'll all be buying blanket-sized scarves and Googling the chicest
    ways to wrap ourselves up in them. Whether you go super simple à
    la Michael Kors with a muted hue slung casually over one shoulder,
    or you go punchier like Saint Laurent and Gabriela Hearst via
    vibrant hues and prints and a fuller-coverage drape, it's hard to
    go wrong with this one.

  <p>
    When you explore the world of astrology, you’re likely to come
    across the terms “Sun sign,” “Moon sign,” and “Rising sign” (also
    known as your Ascendant). These three elements are key components of
    your astrological profile and hold the key to unlocking the
    mysteries of your personality and life. In this user-friendly guide,
    we’ll delve into the profound significance of your Sun, Moon, and
    Rising signs.
  </p>
  <h2>Understanding the Basics:</h2>
  <p>
    Before we dive into the mysteries, let’s clarify what each of these
    signs represents:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Sun Sign:</b> This is the sign most people are familiar with.
      It’s determined by the position of the Sun at the time of your
      birth and reflects your core identity, ego, and vitality. Your Sun
      sign shapes your fundamental traits and is often considered your
      “zodiac sign.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Moon Sign:</b> Your Moon sign is associated with your emotions,
      instincts, and subconscious. It’s determined by the position of
      the Moon at your birth and reveals the emotional facets of your
      personality.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Rising Sign (Ascendant):</b> The Rising sign is the zodiac sign
      that was on the eastern horizon at the moment of your birth. It
      represents your outward personality, how you appear to others, and
      your first impressions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Sun Sign – Your Core Identity:</h3>
  <p>
    Your Sun sign is your astrological essence, the foundation of your
    personality. It influences your basic character traits, how you
    express yourself, and your life goals. Here’s a glimpse of the
    mysteries it holds:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Elemental Energy:</b> Your Sun sign can be one of four
      elements: Fire, Earth, Air, or Water, each with its own qualities.
      Fire signs are passionate and enthusiastic, while Earth signs are
      practical and grounded, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Modality: </b>Sun signs also fall into one of three modalities:
      Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable. Cardinal signs are initiators, Fixed
      signs are steadfast, and Mutable signs are adaptable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Ruling Planet:</b> Each Sun sign is associated with a ruling
      planet. For instance, Leo is ruled by the Sun, giving Leos a
      natural flair for leadership and creativity.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Moon Sign – Your Emotional Depth:</h3>
  <p>
    While your Sun sign represents your external self, your Moon sign
    delves into the emotional undercurrents that shape your inner world.
    Here are the mysteries your Moon sign holds:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Emotional Reactions:</b> Your Moon sign influences how you
      react emotionally to situations. For example, a Cancer Moon is
      sensitive and nurturing, while an Aries Moon is more impulsive and
      assertive.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Relationships:</b> Understanding your Moon sign can shed light
      on your emotional needs in relationships. It can help you connect
      on a deeper level with yourself and your loved ones.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Instincts: </b>Your Moon sign influences your instincts and
      instincts play a crucial role in decision-making. Knowing your
      Moon sign can help you make choices that resonate with your
      emotional truth.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Rising Sign (Ascendant) – Your First Impression:</h3>
  <p>
    Your Rising sign is like the mask you wear when you first meet
    someone. It shapes your initial reactions, appearance, and how
    others perceive you. Here’s how your Rising sign holds its
    mysteries:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Physical Appearance:</b> Your Rising sign can influence your
      physical features, making you resemble others with the same Rising
      sign.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> First Impressions:</b> It affects the way you come across to
      new people. For instance, a Virgo Rising may appear
      detail-oriented and organized upon first meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Life Path: </b>Your Rising sign can provide insights into your
      life path and the experiences you’ll encounter.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your Sun, Moon, and Rising signs are the cornerstones of your
    astrological identity. They hold the key to the mysteries of your
    personality, emotions, and first impressions. By unraveling these
    mysteries, you can gain a deeper understanding of yourself, your
    relationships, and your life path. Embrace the richness of your
    astrological triad and use it as a tool for self-discovery and
    personal growth.

    title: 'How to Overcome Fear of Abandonment: 6 Helpful Worksheets',

    full: `<div>
  <p>
    As humans, we depend on others for survival. Starting from birth,
    the need to be fed, bathed, clothed, sheltered, and cared for is
    essential for survival and optimal function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately, if signs and symptoms of abandonment fears are
    identified and addressed, there are a variety of treatment options
    and paths to emotional healing, leading to a life of flourishing.
  </p>
  <h2>What Is Fear of Abandonment in Psychology?</h2>
  <p>
    Fear of abandonment is not a clinical diagnosis in and of itself. It
    is a form of anxiety and a symptom of several clinical disorders,
    including both mood and personality disorders. Individuals who
    experience abandonment are also more likely to have long-term mental
    health issues (Schoenfelder et al., 2011).
  </p>
  <p>
    Those who struggle with abandonment issues have a persistent fear of
    rejection or isolation. It is often characterized by codependency,
    insecurity, and maladaptive views of power, competence, and
    intimacy, which makes interpersonal relationships and daily
    functioning difficult (D’Rozario & Pilkington, 2021).
  </p>
  <h3>Anxiety</h3>
  <p>
    Anxiety is a foundational component of abandonment fear. Individuals
    who struggle with generalized anxiety disorder or other anxiety
    disorders are more likely to experience fear of abandonment in close
    relationships (Conradi et al., 2016).
  </p>
  <h3>Depression</h3>
  <p>
    Also known as major depressive disorder, depression involves feeling
    sad, a loss of interest in pleasurable activities, changes in sleep
    or weight, loss of energy, feeling worthless or guilty, and
    difficulty concentrating or making decisions. Individuals with
    depression may push people away, question if they are loved or
    worthy of love, and fear rejection from others. Depression can be
    both a cause and effect of abandonment fears. People who have
    experienced neglect or abandonment may struggle with depression, and
    people who are depressed are more likely to have fears of
    abandonment.
  </p>
  <h3>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</h3>
  <p>
    As with depression, PTSD is closely tied with fear of abandonment.
    Symptoms of PTSD include disturbing memories, dreams, feeling
    emotionally numb or cut off from others, irritability, emotional
    dysregulation, and difficulty concentrating (Pilkington et al.,
    2020). Difficulty controlling emotions and feeling distant from
    others naturally lead to feelings of isolation and fear of being
    alone or abandoned. Trauma can also be caused by being abandoned,
    neglected, or abused, creating a vicious cycle if left untreated.
  </p>
  <h3>Signs of Fear of Abandonment</h3>
  <p>Signs of abandonment issues in children include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Acting “clingy” or experiencing emotional dysregulation when left
      alone
    </li>
    <li>
      Excessively worrying or panicking about losing someone close
    </li>
    <li>Generally fearing being alone</li>
    <li>Getting sick more often due to stress</li>
    <li>
      <i>Pushing people away.</i> This presents as withdrawal,
      exhibiting trust issues, and the inability to be open and honest
      with loved ones.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Codependency.</i> Codependency is when individuals rely on
      other people to meet all their emotional needs. People who become
      overly needy and possessive in relationships are often
      codependent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Anger.</i>People with abandonment issues might allow others to
      get close to them but then become aggressive, reactive, or
      volatile if they feel threatened or upset
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How to Overcome Fear of Abandonment</h3>
  <p>
    Individuals who seek help can improve personal wellbeing and
    interpersonal relationships.
  </p>
  <h3>5 Therapy treatment options</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Attachment-based therapy uses a supportive client–therapist bond
      to address issues with mental health, such as depression and
      anxiety. It targets thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and
      interpersonal communication that clients avoid or over-amplify
      based on early-developed attachment styles (Pilkington et al.,
      2021).
    </li>
    <li>
      Behavioral therapy incorporates talk therapy to root out unhealthy
      behaviors and habits that are related to the mental health
      conditions underlying the fear of abandonment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helps clients identify faulty
      thinking patterns or cognitive distortions and replace them with
      more adaptive thinking patterns. This evidence-based form of
      therapy is effective at treating anxiety and depression and
      improving relationships through changing perspectives and
      communication patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Psychodynamic therapy encourages clients to identify and resolve
      unhealthy unconscious and conscious thoughts about past
      experiences. Through improving self-awareness and understanding,
      clients can see how their past may influence present thoughts and
      behaviors and make changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Psychoeducation provides information to a client regarding a
      diagnosis, treatment options, and underlying theories (such as
      attachment theory) that may contribute to abandonment fears.
      Often, understanding and labeling problematic behaviors and fears
      can be one of the most helpful steps in healing.

  <p>
    The undisputed home of young talent, London Fashion Week is nothing if
    not a showcase for the up-and-coming major names. But with a schedule
    bursting full with almost 100 shows, how do you spot the names to
    know?
  </p>
  <p>
    Luckily for you, we've done all the legwork. Introducing the five
    names you should have on your radar in 2024 (and beyond)…
  </p>
  <h2>TOLU COKER</h2>
  <p>
    For her debut solo collection Tolu Coker took us back to her
    motherland. The collection was a celebration of African spirituality
    featuring feminine cuts and tailoring staples that felt like a breath
    of fresh air following the quiet luxury mood of last season.
  </p>
  <p>
    She had us drooling over timeless wardrobe pieces that were given an
    energetic makeover, from denim to the chicest modern mini styles. The
    prints, silhouettes and accessories are still on our minds and truly
    enough to get anyone excited about head-to-toe dressing.
  </p>
  <h3>AHLUWALIA</h3>
  <p>
    Priya Ahluwalia is not new to the LFW line-up but has become one of
    the most hyped up shows of the season, for good reason. Upcycling and
    sustainability is the centre of her design process. The designer uses
    deadstock garments, locally sourced vintage and pre-loved pieces to
    create new designs inspired by her multi-ethnic background.
  </p>
  <p>
    The colours were bold yet romantic with delicate prints and fabrics
    which were well balanced with new-age cowboy boots. With successful
    brand collaborations like Mulberry, Ganni and Adidas under her belt,
    we’re excited to see Ahluwalia continue being a force for
    (sustainable) fashion.
  </p>
  <h3>JOHANNA PARV</h3>
  <p>
    Johanna Parv, also part of the Fashion East collective, has created
    her own innovative design aesthetic which is not only functional but
    very chic. With an impressive CV including fashion brands Balenciaga,
    Christian Dior and Burberry, she is a pro in well constructed pieces.
    Johanna Parv is best known for her monochrome palette, functionality
    and comfort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Light-weight jackets and remixed leggings are given a contemporary
    makeover, making them essentials to any capsule wardrobe. Perfectly
    designed with balance, the collection is ideal dressing for those who
    wish they could live in gym clothes, but fashion. In a nutshell it is
    the most fabulous cycling wear you have ever seen.
  </p>
  <h3>YUHAN WANG</h3>
  <p>
    Yuhan Wang is a Central St Martins graduate (which is always a good
    sign) and has been a favourite during London Fashion Week since her
    debut show in 2020. The designer set out to explore and challenge
    Asia’s traditional standards about femininity through clothes and how
    these connect to Western Culture.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can expect romantic lace and knit separates, exaggerated
    silhouettes and floral prints that feel soft yet empowering. Hailey
    Bieber and Kylie Jenner are already big fans of this cult London brand
    and have worn they’re most coveted pieces which are known for being
    revealing but covered up - an it-girl mood. Her collections are always
    a masterclass in vibrant layering with romantic blazers, gloves,
    removable collars.

        Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein that
        promotes the growth of new brain cells and the formation of
        neuronal circuits in the brain, and is associated with both
        improved memory and learning ability. A review of the literature
        on high-intensity interval training (HIIT) found that HIIT can
        elevate levels of BDNF immediately after exercise and while at
        rest. This means that the same workouts that can help your
        clients get fitter might help make their brains function better
        as well.

      <h2>
        High-Intensity Exercise May Offer More Brain Benefits Than
        Moderate-Intensity Exercise
      </h2>
      <p>
        High-intensity exercise has been shown to produce a greater BDNF
        response than moderate-intensity exercise. Schmolesky, Webb and
        Hansen compared the effects of the intensity and duration of
        exercise on BDNF levels and found that higher intensity
        protocols produced a greater response, reporting that “vigorous
        conditions had the highest proportion of subjects that
        experienced a significant increase in BDNF levels.” Likewise,
        Marquez and colleagues compared 20-minute bouts of continuous
        exercise at 70% of maximal work-rate to a HIIT protocol of 90%
        of maximal work-rate for work and recovery intervals of one
        minute each. They observed that “shorter bouts of high-intensity
        exercise are slightly more effective than continuous
        high-intensity exercise for elevating BDNF.”

      <h2>High-Intensity Exercise Increases Blood Flow to the Brain</h2>
      <p>
        High-intensity exercise not only improves blood flow to the
        working muscles, but it also increases blood flow to the brain,
        which is important for delivering the oxygen and glucose needed
        for optimal performance. Plus, increasing oxygen flow to the
        brain can increase alertness while reducing feelings of fatigue,
        which could help enhance overall job performance. This means
        that a lunchtime HIIT workout could potentially help a client be
        more productive when they return to work in the afternoon.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Strength Training May Make You Smarter</h2>
      <p>
        Strength training—high-intensity or otherwise—has been shown to
        help increase BDNF levels. Church and colleagues compared the
        effects of a high-intensity strength-training program to one
        that focused on the volume of exercise and found that both
        protocols elevated BDNF. According to the study authors,
        “Results indicate that BDNF concentrations are increased after
        an acute bout of resistance exercise, regardless of training
        paradigm, and are further increased during a seven-week program
        in experienced lifters.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>
        High-Intensity Exercise Makes It Easier to Achieve a Flow State
      </h2>
      <p>
        A HIIT workout provides the right triggers, including clear
        goals and unambiguous feedback, to initiate something often
        referred to as the flow state, which can help create a positive
        and focused mindset that carries over into other aspects of a
        client’s daily life.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>
        Performing High-Intensity Exercise Enhances Self-Confidence
      </h2>
      <p>
        Completing a challenging HIIT workout can help give clients the
        confidence to accomplish other daunting tasks. Once a client has
        completed a series of challenging high-intensity exercises,
        professional tasks such as giving a presentation or making a
        cold call to a potential client may seem easy by comparison.
        Additionally, completing a couple of HIIT workouts could help
        clients realize that they can exercise successfully, which is an
        important component for establishing self-efficacy and long-term
        adherence to an exercise program.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Finally, another oft-cited benefit of high-intensity exercise,
    particularly HIIT workouts, is that they don’t last as long as
    traditional workouts, which has been shown to be preferable among
    exercisers. Thum and colleagues compared HIIT to moderate-intensity
    continuous exercise and observed that HIIT may be more preferable
    because “individuals report greater enjoyment due to its time
    efficiency and constantly changing stimulus.” Ultimately, the most
    effective workout is the one that is completed, and a shorter
    workout is often more “doable” than a longer one.

    title: 'Dark Velvet Hair Is The Winter Colour you Need To Try',

  <p>
    While food and drinks have headlined the major beauty trends
    recently (latte makeup, strawberry girl, mocha nails), textures are
    taking us into winter. And dark velvet hair is here to pick up where
    latte left off. We already saw cashmere blonde pick up a fan base
    last year, but for 2023 velvet is most definitely ruling the beauty
    trends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Velvet makeup has picked up a fan base that includes Selena Gomez,
    Tina Kunakey and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. And velvet nails is
    limbering up to topple glazed donut nails from the top spot after a
    year plus in first place. The mani trades a chrome sheen for a soft
    sparkle, plus it offers extra nuzzly dimension that feels sumptuous,
    luxurious and perfect for the colder seasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same goes for our hair colours. With the sun setting earlier and
    less daylight to enjoy, we are embracing the natural shift to
    moodier hues, like mocha, cherry cola and red velvet. In fact, we're
    loving black velvet and navy velvet for that matter, too. For
    autumn-winter, we're seeing lots of hair shades come through that
    are classic velvet shades. And you can play them up with the finish
    of your hair, too. Semi-matte strands pair perfectly in contrast to
    the ultra glossy, liquid shine we've been seeing lots of, so
    mattifying hairsprays and texturisers can add extra semi-soft
    dimension.
  </p>
  <h2>Dark velvet red</h2>
  <p>
    We didn't think red hair could get any hotter but for winter, dark
    red velvet hair is showing us otherwise. Like most hair colours,
    there is a seasonal shift for ginger strands: “The natural
    progression goes from soft coppers into stronger coppers [for the
    autumn]; then into punchier reds [for winter] — and we are already
    seeing this clear direction,” says trend forecaster and top London
    hair stylist, Tom Smith. So, we’re seeing richer velvet reds,
    instead of the ambery coppers of earlier seasons.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you aren’t a natural redhead and are thinking ahead to the
    grow-out phase, worry not. LA hair stylist, Dhairius Thomas, says
    that this colour will look even more eye-catching with time,
    especially if you have dark brown roots as it’ll create an edgy
    black to red ombré look.

  <h2>Black velvet</h2>
  <p>
    Ultra dark brunettes and midnight black make a rich, striking
    statement while still feeling classic and wearable. We’ve noticed
    celebs skipping licks of honey and caramel highlights for a moodier,
    cooler palette that’s a little flatter and less dimensional, but
    it’s luxe and intentional.
